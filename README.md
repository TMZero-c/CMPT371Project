# some kind of social deduction impostor among us sus game
### we really need to work on this since we have to write a report and record a demo video

## what we're meant to do

- server starts and clients conect
- ask for name from clients
- everyone readies up after inputting name
- once everyone is ready, game starts - each person is given a role (impostor or normal)
- normals get a topic, impostors do not
- players choose to enter chat rooms, with a limit of how many players may enter a room
- typing occurs
- after a set period of time, players are forcefully ejected out of rooms and into a main chat room
- voting occurs to determine impostor
- repeat until either impostor remains within 2 players or impostor is voted out

probably..

i think this is how it goes
divulge any questions to the group chat
