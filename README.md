# some kind of social deduction impostor among us sus game
### we really need to work on this since we have to write a report and record a demo video

## things we still need to do
- display messages for each game state for better user experience
- add ability to have more players (with multithreading)
- fix bugs
- any other fixes or features or anything to complete



## what we're meant to do

- server starts and clients conect
- ask for name from clients
- everyone readies up after inputting name
- once everyone is ready, game starts - each person is given a role (impostor or normal)
- normals get a topic, impostors do not
- players choose to enter chat rooms, with a limit of how many players may enter a room
- typing occurs
- after a set period of time, players are forcefully ejected out of rooms and into a main chat room
- voting occurs to determine impostor
- repeat until either impostor remains within 2 players or impostor is voted out


## TO PLAY

- Someone starts the server
- Clients join
- Game start when all clients have typed ready


## bugs that may be there

- room allocation is not updateing correctly
- people can't join
- end_game ends the game sloppily
- game_stage must be forced to start voting_sequence
- other random stuff


probably..

i think this is how it goes
divulge any questions to the group chat
