# Blend In

## DESCRIPTION
Blend In is a real-time multiplayer social deduction game inspired by Among Us. In this game, players are randomly assigned a role, and must go through a series of timed discussions to identify who is secretly the Imposter.

## HOW DOES IT WORK? 
- server starts and clients conect
- ask for name from clients
- everyone readies up after inputting name
- once everyone is ready, game starts - each person is given a role (impostor or normal)
- normals get a topic, impostors do not
- players choose to enter chat rooms, with a limit of how many players may enter a room
- typing occurs
- after a set period of time, players are forcefully ejected out of rooms and into a main chat room
- voting occurs to determine impostor
- repeat until either impostor remains within 2 players or impostor is voted out


## TO PLAY
- Someone starts the server
- Players starting 'clients.py' will be asked for IP and Name
- The game starts when all clients have pressed ready
